# Flow Webtools

Flow Webtools is a CSS framework that provides a set of features that make it easy to create beautiful websites within a set timespan.


## Getting Started

To use Flow Webtools,
you have a multitude of options - 

``` main.min.css ``` - DO NOT USE; This is not very updated, better to use main.css instead.

``` main.css ``` - Non minified CSS code for Webtools.

There is also a SASS version of Flow - 

``` main.scss ```

The sass version is the recommended version as it allows for extended customisation of styles.

## Javascript Utilities

Javascript utilities are useful for more advanced kinds of elements - such as a 'rotary menu'. It is a doughnut-shaped radial menu that can be used for navigation or some form of interaction. Currently it is not recommended for use.
```
rotarymenu.js
```
