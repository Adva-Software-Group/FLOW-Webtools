# Flow Webtools

Flow Webtools is a CSS framework that provides a set of features that make it easy to create beautiful websites within a set timespan.


## Getting Started

To use Flow Webtools,
you have a multitude of options - 

``` main.min.css ``` - DO NOT USE; This is not very updated, better to use main.css instead.

``` main.css ``` - Non minified CSS code for Webtools.

There is also a SASS version of Flow - 

``` main.scss ```

The sass version is the recommended version as it allows for extended customisation of styles.


To install, simply download and install Flow Webtools and put one or more of the css/sass files into your project and voila!

For JS files, simply move or copy them and link them into your project.

## Javascript Utilities

Javascript utilities are useful for more advanced kinds of elements - such as a 'rotary menu'. It is a doughnut-shaped radial menu that can be used for navigation or some form of interaction. Currently it is not recommended for use.
```
rotarymenu.js
```
